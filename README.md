## Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of time series analysis and forecasting using historical stock price data. The main objectives are to:
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis.
- Decompose the time series to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals.
- Test for stationarity and apply necessary transformations.
- Build and validate an ARIMA model for forecasting.
- Present the findings and forecasts.

## Data Preparation and Exploration

We begin by downloading historical price data for Apple Inc. using the `yfinance` library. The dataset includes the following columns:
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Adj Close
- Volume

Initial data exploration involves:
- Checking for missing values.
- Calculating summary statistics.
- Visualizing the data through line plots and histograms.
- Analyzing the correlation between different variables.

## Time Series Decomposition

We apply seasonal decomposition to the 'Close' prices to break down the time series into its components:
- Observed
- Trend
- Seasonal
- Residual

This helps us understand underlying patterns in the data.

## Stationarity Testing and Transformation

We test the stationarity of the time series using:
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test
- Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) Test

If the series is non-stationary, we apply differencing to achieve stationarity.

## Forecasting Model Development

We use the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for forecasting. The process involves:
- Splitting the data into training and test sets.
- Performing a grid search to find the best ARIMA parameters.
- Validating the model and making forecasts.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The results are visualized by plotting the actual vs. forecasted values.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of time series analysis and forecasting using historical stock data. The ARIMA model provides a reasonable forecast, and the steps taken ensure a thorough understanding of the data and model performance.
